                    <p>The following suggestions about how to play Dobble Debate were developed in co-creation
                        workshops. You can use our <a href="bake.html">bake-your-own</a> assets to play them.</p>
                    <h2>The Narrative Game</h2>
                    <details>
                        <summary>This way to play Dobble Debate was invented in Gdansk, Poland.</summary> <a
                            href="bake.html/#cards">three decks of cards</a> (ability, situation and point cards)
                        are shuffled together. One card is given to each person. The group sits in a circle and the
                        gameplay starts with a volunteer. That person starts to tell a story, though just a
                        few lines based on the card they were dealt. Next the person beside them continues to build the
                        narrative with a few lines based on their card. The storytelling continues until everyone in the
                        circle has participated.
                  </details>
                    <h2>The Cooperative Game</h2>
                    <details>
                        <summary>This version was developed by students in Guanajuato, Mexico.</summary>
                        The group is divided up into teams. Each member of each team is given <a
                            href="bake.html/#cards">an ability card</a>. Each team is given <a href="bake.html/#cards">a
                            situation card.</a> The team members work together using their assigned abilities to develop
                        strategies for helping each other in the situation that has been dealt to the team. Every
                        ability must be used when the team is figuring out how to navigate a situation.
                    </details>
                    <h2>The Erasing Labels Game</h2>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Advisors from a Centre of Welfare and Support at the University of Coventry in the
                            United Kingdom devised this gameplay.</summary>
                        Put duct tape over or erase all the labels on <a href="bake.html/#cards">the ability cards</a>.
                        Distribute the cards to each player along with <a href="bake.html/#cards">a situation card</a>.
                        In turn, each player suggests how they would navigate the given situation with their particular
                        collection of circumstances and characteristics.
                    </details>
                    <h2>The Intersectional Game</h2>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Our team from Toronto, Canada thought up this way of playing Dobble Debate.</summary>
                        Divide the group into teams. Have each team choose <a href="bake/#avatars.html">a sensation
                            avatar</a>, such as water, grass, sunshine etc. to represent them. Give each team <a
                            href="bake.html/#cards">an ability card</a> and <a href="bake.html/#cards">five situation
                            cards</a>. Have each team develop stories about how their avatar with its innate
                        characteristics and given ability moves from situation to situation.
