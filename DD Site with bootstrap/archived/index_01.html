<p>Dobble Debate is a game that uses play and humour to help people talk and learn about disabilities.</p>
		
	<!-- Explanation of Terminology -->	
	<details><summary>Why use the word "disabilities"?</summary>
    Dobble Debate recognizes that every individual’s lived experience is different, and changes significantly based on their current environment. Therefore, we would like to refine our use of the term disability by explicitly acknowledging D/deafness, disability, differing abilities , autism, and neurodiversity plus (DDDAND+). This acronym does not cover all the diverse identities usually lumped under ‘disability’; we are using it to draw attention to the variety of human experience and everyday innovation. Please get in touch if you would like to comment or give us feedback.</details>
